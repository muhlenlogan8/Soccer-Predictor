# Weird things to note:
# Some years prior used golden goal which is no longer used (This is listed as "(a.e.t./g.g.)" in the score column)
# Some years prior (Found in 1954) allow extra time during group stage matches that result in ties if no winner is found after the extra time
# This is "awesome" because it means there are "(a.e.t.)" entries in the score column but no penalties were taken so I must account for this
# It also seems that some years don't even show the penalty results in the table I'm pulling from
# I may compensate for this by checking which team has a game after the fact but there may be a better way
# Another awesome thing, in 1938, Austria withdrew from the tournament so the match they were supposed to play was a walkover, which is listed as "w/o[a]" in the score column
# Fun history: Nazi Germany invaded and annexed Austria three months before the 1938 world cup and forced 5 Austrian players to play for the German team
# Germany ended up losing their match anyways

# TODO: Account for years such as 1938 where the penalty kick results are not shown in the table I am pulling from
# Currently this year is in trouble_years and the penalty kick results are set to "N/A" for all matches in this year
# Must identify if the match went to penalties or not and if it did, find the penalty kick results from another source
# Nowing if the match is a group stage match or not will help since group stage (a.e.t.) matches didn't go to penalties but later matches did
