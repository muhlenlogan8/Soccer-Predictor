# Soccer Predictor

Soccer Predictor is a web application that predicts the outcome of a match between two national soccer teams. It uses historical World Cup data and current FIFA rankings to make predictions using a Random Forest Classifier.

## Vision
I started this project to introduce myself to machine learning in Python. I'm a big fan of watching soccer and wanted to see if I could create an application that predicts who would win between two national soccer teams. I intend for this project to be a learning experience where I can learn and experiment with machine learning, web scraping, and Taipy application development.

## Current State
The application is functioning and does attempt to predict soccer match winners based on their FIFA rank. I am using a random forest classification model and, for the most part, the predictions are accurate and reliable, however, I intend to add more variables and data for the model to train on. The data I'm looking to incorporate into the training will be international-friendly and international tournament data.

## How Soccer Predictor Works

#### Web Scraping


#### Data Cleaning

#### Machine Learning

#### Web Application

#### Future Enhancements
- Add more variables for the machine learning model to train on. Possible variables could be average goals scored, average goals against, World Cup games played, World Cup wins, average player cost (will need players on each team currently and their salary), and most recent match result.
- Pull more data to train on such as international friendlies and other tournament competitions outside the World Cup.
- Experiment with other machine learning models
- Attempt to implement parallel computing to scrape data to speed up the process.
